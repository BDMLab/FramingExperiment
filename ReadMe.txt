This is a Psychopy adaptation of the experimental design from the paper:
De Martino et al (2006) Frames, Biases, and Rational Decision-Making in the Human Brain. Science, 313(5787), 684-687.
    
The code is written by Tomas Folke.

There are two versions of this experiment, one with the original colour scheme (“FramingOriginal.py”)and one with a colour scheme that has been modified to suit colourblind participants (“FramingColourblind.py”).

The original printed instructions for the task can be found as a pdf in the folder “Instructions”. “Modifying Framing Loop.ipnb” is an ipython notebook designed to easily change the search path for the images in the condition files whilst leaving the remaining conditions intact.

If you have any questions about the code feel free to contact me on tomas.folke@gmail.com.
